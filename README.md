# malaria_mltplx_ampseq
All code-related files pertaining to the Neafsey lab malaria mltplx ampseq project

## To-do:
- make into R package so others (Emily?) can take lead
- add CTSA on its own (to compare)
- add 24 SNP barcode (to compare)
- Bronwyn asked: what is the minimally informative step (e.g. at what point does the GTseq panel become useless)? Evaluate in light of results on low parasitaemia samples 

## Viz ideas for paper: 
- add chrom lengths to position plot (static)
- add dynamic annotations to effective cardinality and diversity plots (Rshiny)
